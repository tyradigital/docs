Example Configuration:

```lua
{
	title = "My Category",
    // highlight-next-line
	categoryType = "rank",
    // highlight-next-line
    minimumRank = 123,
}
```

:::note Group Config

Make sure your group configuration is enabled with the correct group ID!

:::

To set a category to a minimum group rank - set the `categoryType` to `"rank"`

Then, set your `minimumRank` to a number between 1 and 255
_(You can technically set it to 0 but then that defeats the purpose of it being rank locked anyways)_
