## Initial Setup

Once you have imported the `.RBXM` file that you have downloaded, ungroup everything in the folder where it asks you to.

## Adding Buses

To add buses to the spawner, move the model into the 'Buses' folder within ServerStorage.

Next, go to `ReplicatedStorage -> Buses -> Spawner -> Data` and pick a category. You should start with `Category1` for now. Copy the `BUSNUMBERHEREEXAMPLE` `Configuration` Item and paste it into which category you would like.

The categories are listed in order 1-4.

Once you have pasted the value into the folder, rename the value to the bus name and check the `Attributes` section of the value in the Properties tab.

You will see different values. You are free to customize these to your liking.

## Attributes

| Name           |  Type   |                                                                                                                                                                                               Description |

## Model Name & It's use

The Model Name Attribute is primarily used for showing the user what the model bus is when they spawn it.

In your [configuration](/docs/rbx-products/bus-spawner/configuration), you can see there is a value named `busModelSpawnType`. It is set to `"basic"` and recommended thst way for new users.

If you want to set it to `"advanced"`, that is fine and advanced does increase performance by a lot, as each bus model adds on to server lag, which then goes impacts all players.

To see how to use the `"advanced"` option, [see here.](/docs/rbx-products/bus-spawner/advanced-spawning)

If you are **not** planning on using the advanced option, you may delete the `BusLocations` Folder in workspace.
