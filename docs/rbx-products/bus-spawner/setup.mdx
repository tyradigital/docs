## Initial Setup

Once you have imported the `.RBXM` file that you have downloaded, ungroup everything in the folder where it asks you to.

## Adding Buses

To add buses to the spawner, move the model into the 'Buses' folder within ServerStorage.

Next, go to `ReplicatedStorage -> Buses`. Copy the `00` `BoolValue` and paste it into which category you would like.

`CategoryR` is the primary spawning category, `CategoryR2` is the secondary spawning category.

Once you have pasted the value into the folder, rename the value to the bus name and check the `Attributes` section of the value in the Properties tab.

You will see different values. You are free to customize these to your liking.
