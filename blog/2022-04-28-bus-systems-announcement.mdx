Yep, you heard that right.

Tyra Roblox is coming out soon with massive upgrades on current genx bus systems.

:::caution Notice!
This system is **NOT** complete and may have bugs

Documentation has **NOT** been released yet, and so links may be broken.

Images & other media haven't been added to this blogpost yet.

## What's upgraded?

### PLUGINS!

This is the main new feature! Introducing plugins, the great new way for developers to interact and add features to their bus via scripting, without needing to change internal system functions. You are even allowed to sell these plugins! Currently you can change what happens:

- After the bus is all loaded and ready (currently nothing happens but you could just print something or do something else)
- When a player enters the bus vehicle seat
- When a player leaves the bus vehicle seat
- When a key is pressed on the keyboard
- More to come!

You can do certain "event" overrides to override what happens when a player enters or leaves a bus, this means you can ignore what normally happens when a player enter or leaves a bus, and have it do your own thing with the plugins. You can also leave it be, and still run your plugin without the need to override current "events." 

As well, we have allowed you to override what happens by default with **default** controls. This means you can change what you want to happen when someone presses <kbd>V</kbd> for ambers/warning lights.

The last I'm going to say about this in this blogpost about plugins is that with your plugin, you can still run the remote events for controls, as showed in [this documentation](/docs/rbx-products/upgraded-bus-system/plugins/controls-events)

You may also learn how to create your very first plugin [here](/docs/rbx-products/upgraded-bus-system/plugins/your-first-plugin)

### Other Features & Capabilities

- [x] Incandescent Fading lights now working, just set them
- [x] Revamped and more customizable settings!
- [x] Use plugins to interact with bus controls events! (See above)
- [x] Color customizations for certain lights (more to come)!
- [x] More to come!

### Bug fixes from the current genx systems

- [x] Camera now starts correctly, no need to press <kbd>Y</kbd> on your keyboard!
- [x] This could be either section, but foglight works now like in Gen 9 buses without any special scripts needed, just press <kbd>F</kbd> on your keyboard!
- [x] Hate it when you accidentally press <kbd>R</kbd> on the keyboard and you start driving with your mouse? Well now you don't have to do that anymore! It's now just a regular keybind, and to disable the default functionality you can just set it to be overriden! 
- [x] More to come!

## How much does it cost?

It only costs 250 robux for the upgrade, and each "Plugin" sold by me will be for 150 robux.

## What does the install/upgrade process look like?

It won't take too long, but there is documentation [here](/docs/rbx-products/upgraded-bus-system/upgrade)

## Does it work with other buses that aren't GenX?

There's a chance it would work with Gen 8 or Gen 9 buses as they use similar systems already, but no guarantee. Though, any buses not created by mike (Nova_LX) will not be compatible, however I would be happy to help other bus creators implement some features like these. If you have a Huxley Bus, no it won't work but I heard they have neat systems on theirs!

## Is this whitelisted or obfuscated?

Due to how most of this is already available from leaked buses (this was not a full rewrite), we will be going by an honor system in the hopes since this is cheap, that it isn't stolen. We will blacklist anyone who leaks it or trys to resell It, and we encourage other groups to blacklist users from buying their plugins (if any group or developers want to make their own) if they illegitimately have obtained this upgrade.
