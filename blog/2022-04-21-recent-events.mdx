This blog post will outline the events that occurred recently in the community regarding the Bus Spawner product.

:::note Quick Notice
The ABC spawner will be mentioned later on, and it was also designed fully by Fisher.

## The Basic Timeline (TL;DR)

- We were notified of a spawner copy
- We talked with the owner regarding this and they admitted copying the UI design from Tyra Digital & ABC (America Bus Company), and other small aspects
- Despite the copy already being put up for sale, the owner stated they would redo the UI.
- When banned for violating our Terms of Service, they claimed they did not copy.

## What Happened

The first instance of the incident occurred on the 19th of April. Tyra Digital staff were notified of a potential leaked version of our spawner.
We swiftly investigated this and found that, whilst it was not leaked, it did infact bare a very close resemblance to our original spawner.

We were shown this image announcing it, and how it is for sale.

We were also suprised by the fact that he holds a senior developer position in a large/mainstream bus group.
And we hope this behavior isn't allowed and is handled accordingly by that company.

We made peaceful attempts to negoatiate this, although we were not aware of the scale of the incident.
A member of the "knockoff" spawner's staff team happened to own a copy of our spawner and was in our Discord server, they acted in an inappropriate manner by
disrespecting staff members and being irrational. Due to this violation of our rules, they were later banned.
After long deliberation from development & community management staff, the decision was made to ban those involved for a **violation of our Terms of Service**.

We feel this is a generous punishment, considering no blacklist was handed out to those involved, or the group. We even allowed an appeal after 2 months, how nice.

:::caution Note
It should be noted shortly after the bans were executed, a member of the opposing group joined the Discord and created a ticket, acting in a very inappropriate manner, disrespecting
support staff that responded to the ticket. They were not banned.

### Evidence

**One of the more obvious pieces was his admin panel. (Top image is from Tyra Digital, original; bottom image is the copy)**

**An even MORE obvious part was the actual bus number buttons (Top image is from Tyra Digital, original which is also used in ABCs spawner; bottom image is the copy)**

**Another example is with the main spawner screen, still resembling aspects from Tyra Digital and ABC**

The spawner view at the top is almost indentical to ours, and the one for ABC, its only difference is that it is above the primary frame.

**There are also some similar items that add-on to this that by themselves don't warrant any sort of copying, but can be a little bit suspicious or insulting**

There is a pretty similar info card UI design, with it being on the right side and having a similar top to bottom layout from the ABC Spawner, but this could easily be dismissed.

We also have reason to believe some of our original source code was stolen for some, as after some inspection, their code for tweening (moving a frame smoothly across the screen)
is the exact same, despite the tween settings being drastically unique.

Lastly for this section, while again, these elements are all fine by themselves, when you put them together it becomes extremely probable that most of it was stolen or copied.
The "tier names" are also the same with "Basic" and "Pro" options available. At this time no "ELITE" option is available. Again, we can't stress this enough, this is fine on its own,
but putting it together with other elements is not a good look.

## Future Security

### The steps we are taking to ensure product security to prevent future incidents

Due to the incident that has happened, we have enabled whitelisting and obfuscation and most of our products, and will continue to do so in the future.
This allows us to fully control who can and cannot access our products and services.
We are also considering using a lua-to-gui method, making the UI create via a script rather than being instantly available and ready for copying.

## Conclusion

As a result of this, we have taken reasonable actions on this member by resulting them with a permenant ban with an appeal allowed after 2 months.

Please do not go and harass or raid any persons or servers involved in this, as we don't want to escelate it more than it already is.
